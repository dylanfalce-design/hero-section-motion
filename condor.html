<h1 class="project"> Project Discribtion:</h1>

<h4 class="basic">Basic Description:</h4>

<p class="p1"> For this project we were tasked to create a single page site, a type specimen on our chosen variable font. I choose Condor, by David Jonathan Ross. This site includes animation, text, and designs used to capture the art deco look of the font. Through this site you can see a brief history of the font, weights, and widths, as well as a link back to its creator's page. Below is an in-depth look into my process, thoughts, and problems along the way. </p>

<h4 class="read"> README.md:</h4>

<p class="p2"> Using both HTML and CSS, I built up the one-page site. Similar to the Art Deco movement that inspired the font originally, I used its look to create my site. I used SVG files, Links, a navigation bar, and CSS grid to create this site effectively. Learning to use these aspects of coding was difficult but it helped me learn more and understand other aspects of CSS that I wasn't yet comfortable with. Figma was a big help during this project as well. I used it to create my designs and backgrounds for the header and other sections. This way I could export them as SVGs and fill out much of my page without worrying about the code. For hours I worked to get my idea on Figma, which allowed me to get the look I wanted with HTML and CSS later. Getting the fronts and backgrounds to load were the two hardest aspects of this project for me. It took me many tries to get the backgrounds to load but it was extremely rewarding when I finally got them, it was also a great learning experience and once I fixed one I knew how to fix those issues in the future when they came up. Overall this project was a great experience, it allowed me to improve both my CSS and design skills while also learning to problem-solve and fix issues independently. I am very happy with how my site came out and am excited to work on more sites in the future. </p>

<h1 class="project"> Glyphs and Animation:</h1>

<!-- this is where photos will go  -->

<h4 class="basic">Moving Glyphs:</h4>

<p class="p1"> For my design I knew I wanted to add some element of animation. I wanted to use animation to both bring enfaces to text as well as use it as the main focus and show off the font in motion.  I ended up coming up with the idea to make it its own section. Titled “Moving Glyphs” it was one of the areas I ended up being the most satisfied with. All four glyphs move, and in all different ways. This allowed me to experiment with what they can do while also showing the reader what these faces might look like in an animation or gif. I made sure to add all different movements and weights in order to accurately show the variation in the style or movement. Though the final product is clean and but together this isn't how it started.  </p>

<h4 class="read"> Animation Issues:</h4>

<p class="p2"> This was one area I had to spend some extra time on. getting the animations to feel unique yet fit together was a challenge. It was also difficult to get them to actually show the animation I was trying to achieve, on many tries I changed the size and speed of the animation but nothing happened. eventually I found the issues (mostly spelling or positioning errors) and the problems fixed themselves.  In the end I had to deal with some positioning issues but through trial and error I got these fixed as well. </p>

<h1 class="project"> Mobile Tests and Problems:</h1>

<!-- more images of mobile tests -->

<h4 class="basic">Mobile Discription:</h4>

<p class="p1"> Here are some of  my early sketches for my mobile version of my site. I wanted the sections to feel different from one another and this was more obvious when viewed on mobile. the colors appear and disappear abruptly but flow together and fit one they are in the bigger picture. Because I used a very geometric and grid-like framework for my project the parts all came together well. Even though they fit well together it was much harder in practice and took me a long time to fix the code and set it up correctly.  </p>

<h4 class="read"> Issues With Mobile View:</h4>

<p class="p2">After I made the early sketches I didn't think of the mobile format for some time. this wasn’t a smart Idea and soon I found that my web interface was much more developed than my mobile, and it wasn’t even close. I also realized many of my sketches used in Figma for both web and mobile were not able to be used on CSS because of the outline. This pushed many of my designs down awkwardly,  causing the font to overlap and get cut off the screen at different areas. To solve this I changed the parameters for my mobile version to take the two column design of the web and put it into a single column design for mobile. I then went back to Figma and redesigned the patterns for mobile, this was time consuming but worth it for the overall look of the site. After I assured that all the information was the same for mobile and web versions than I was satisfied with my design.  </p>
